# Known issues / bugs so far

-> Only imports products which belong to one seller and one category <br>
-> Staffs accounts and bulk imported users are all given system generated password "Demo123@" <br>
-> Imports on products has no images so the system assigns them default image <br>
-> All uploaded XLS Files are deleted upoun processing to avoid storage consumption <br>
-> Staffs accounts has no feature to verify their emails - Assumption that all staff emails are valid <br>
-> Cart is not retained after a user has logged out. The logout session is destroying clearing cart by default <br>
-> Delivery charges are set to a constant $15 dollars - This is hard coded. It should be updated later.
